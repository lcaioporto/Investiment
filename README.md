# Investimento Financeiro
Python repository that allows the user to evaluate how long it would take to become a millionaire by investing a certain amount of money per month.
Furthermore, the program asks the user how long they would maintain this monthly investment rate, and prints the result at the end.

By default, a CDB income tax (IR) discount is considered:
<p>
     Up to 180 days: 22.5%;
</p>
<p>
     From 181 to 360 days: 20%;
</p>
<p>
     From 361 to 720 days: 17.5%;
</p>
<p>
     More than 721 days: 15%.
</p>
Note: IR is only applied to profit.

IOF is disregarded because time periods tend to be long.
It is assumed that there is no administration fee.
Daily liquidity income is considered to occur only on business days (weekends are not considered).
<p>
     It is important to highlight that the program presents an approximate and not entirely realistic result, as the IOF and possible rate fluctuations that may occur over the years are disregarded.
